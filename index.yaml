    Basic examples showing how to interact with the API.
  entries:

  - id: browsing
    title: Browsing projects
    docs: |
      This tutorial shows an example of how to browse among the different entries (projects). 
      Each project contains metadata such as names of the authors, parameters of the simulation, etc.

    title: Mining project data
    docs: |
      This tutorial shows an example of how to mine data from a specific project. 
      The project is the main entry in the database and it contains mostly metadata, 
      but it is also an index of additional data which may be requested as well.
    notebook: project_tutorial.ipynb

  - id: trajectory
    title: Visualizing trajectory data
    docs: |
      This tutorial shows an example of how to download structure and trajectory data 
      from a specific project. Then data is loaded into a molecular viewer and displayed.
    notebook: trajectory_tutorial.ipynb

- id: precalculated
  title: Pre-calculated analyses
  docs: |
    Examples reproducing how some of the pre-calculated analyses are done by the automatic workflow.
  entries:

  - id: rmsd
    title: RMSD analysis
    docs: |
      In this example we reproduce the pre-calculated root mean squared deviation analysis (RMSD) performed by the data processing workflow.
    notebook: rmsd_analysis.ipynb

  - id: rmsf
    title: Fluctuation analysis
    docs: |
      In this example we reproduce the pre-calculated atom fluctuation analysis (RMSF) performed by the data processing workflow.
    notebook: rmsf_analysis.ipynb

  - id: rgyr
    title: Radius of gyration analysis
    docs: |
      In this example we reproduce the pre-calculated radius of gyrations analysis (RGYR) performed by the data processing workflow.
    notebook: rgyr_analysis.ipynb

- id: single
  title: Single trajectory analyses
  docs: |
    Additional analyses which are not run by default but any user may run in any available simulation.
  entries:

  - id: clustering
    title: Clustering analysis
    docs: |
      Here we show an example of an alternative methodology for clustering.
    notebook: clustering.ipynb

  - id: dccm
    title: Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix
    docs: |
      Here is an additional analysis: the Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix.
    notebook: dccm.ipynb

- id: usecases
  title: Meta-analysis use cases
  docs: |
    Analyses run over several simulations.
  entries:

  - id: protein_ligands
    title: Protein-ligands interaction analysis
    docs: |
      In this example we intend to analyze simulations of ACE2 protein with different ligands (drugs).
      We aim to compare, for each ligand, how both electrostatic and Van de Waals energies change.
      For this test we are using 78 atomistic MD trajectories from D. E. Shaw already loaded in the MDDB database.
    notebook: ace2_ligands_analysis.ipynb

  - id: protein_protein
    title: Protein-protein interaction analysis
    docs: |
      In this example we intend to analyze the interaction between human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
      and the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain. We want to compare, for the N501Y mutation, how electrostatic energies, 
      Van der Waals energies and hydrogen bonds change on this residue and its surrounding residues.

      For this test we will use RBD-ACE2 atomistic MD trajectories already loaded in the MDDB database. 
      Specifically, we will use a group of simulations from Mary Hongying Cheng including different varaints of the virus.
    notebook: ace2_rbd_interaction_analysis.ipynb

  - id: protein_nucleic
    title: Protein-nucleic acid interaction analysis
    docs: |
      In this example we intend to analyze the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex and a fragment of RNA. 
      We want to find and visualize the aminoacid with the highest electrostatic and Van der Waals energies and thus the one 
      which is carrying the interaction.

      For this test we will use Polymerase atomistic MD trajectories already loaded in the MDDB database from 
      different groups.
